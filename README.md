# SMV Metrics
Sophisticated Sexual Market Value (SMV) calculator and analysis tool designed with a cyberpunk/sci-fi aesthetic. Based on Rational Male praxeology, this application provides users with tools to calculate theoretical market value, analyze relationship dynamics through hypergamy checks, and track metrics over time.

## Features

- **Advanced Calculator**: Computes SMV scores based on biological age, gender, and weighted variables including socioeconomic status, physical fitness, game/behavior, beauty, and history.
- **Hypergamy Analysis**: A comparative module ("Versus Mode") to visualize power dynamics and relationship stability between two profiles.
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts and data visualizations powered by Recharts to display age-based decay curves and score compositions.
- **Offline History**: Built with an offline-first architecture using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) to securely store and retrieve past calculations without external cloud dependencies.
- **Theory Database**: In-app documentation explaining core concepts like "The Wall," Hypergamy, and Optimization Protocols.
